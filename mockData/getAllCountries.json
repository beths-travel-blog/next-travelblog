          "html": "<p>This may be slightly premature but Brisbane may be my favourite city ever. Admittedly, I’d never left Europe before now but that’s besides the point.  In addition to daily sunshine (even in winter), super friendly locals and remarkable views wherever you go, there is such a relaxed atmosphere here. I must confess that I didn’t know much about Brisbane before deciding to study abroad; all I knew is that I wanted to go to Australia. I was under the impression that Sydney and Melbourne were the most popular choices so I chose Bris thinking I’d have a higher chance of getting a place. After spending the first two weeks exploring Brisbane and meeting the locals (and by locals I mean kangaroos and koalas), I’m so glad I chose this university and also somewhat guilty for not knowing more about it prior to arrival.</p><p></p><p><strong>Initial thoughts</strong></p><p>The whole concept of moving to the other side of the world didn’t phase me too much until saying bye to my mum at the airport. After that point, I didn’t know if I felt more nervous or excited. As a bit of a home-bird, I was worried about wanting to return in the first week. It was reassuring that I had a house to move straight into but I wouldn’t recommend this unless you know someone in Aus to check it’s legit. The other options are halls (very expensive) or staying in a hostel while you house hunt. Now I’m here, I’ve realized hostels aren’t as daunting as they seem.</p><p>The time spent from finishing second year, up to my 23 hour plane journey consisted entirely of spending time with friends and families so I wasn’t best prepared. Both my hand and hold luggage were overweight which incurred a £92 excess fee (1kg in excess costs the same as 8kg) and I stupidly packed my laptop into the hold. Of course, on arrival in Bris I found my laptop screen to be smashed. However, I’d already met some lovely people on the plane and a group of other students in the free UQ-airport-transfer who I’m now good friends with so this didn’t dampen my spirits too much! Plus the dreaded long haul journey was over and I was living in Australia so it was hard to be glum.</p><p></p><p><strong>UNI</strong></p><p>Disregarding the time difference, jet lag and lack of rain, the move felt a lot like returning to Manchester. I’d already adapted to living away from home and fending for myself; I still keep forgetting I’m nearly 16,500 km away from home. Nonetheless, there are many differences. I can guarantee you’ll never arrive at uni feeling gloomy and wet after a rainy walk along Oxford Road; the journey to UQ is a sunny one. Walking around campus you’ll find turkeys, ibises and bearded dragons but this feels completely normal after a few days. There are magpies too but be warned: they may swoop you. There’s also a multitude of exciting societies to choose from. I’ve had to try my hardest to stay away from the football club as I want to experience things I can’t in Manchester. Instead I’ve joined the wakeboard/waterski society and yoga society. Yoga is $5 for the whole semester which is extremely good value for money. UQ also has QUEST (Queensland University Exchange Student socieTy) which makes it soo easy to meet like-minded people and travel the whole east coast!</p><p><strong>Time well spent</strong></p><p>Until now, I’ve very much been in holiday mode. I can’t explain how fast time is going here and how much I’ve seen already. Some of the activities with QUEST include trekking up to Mt Coot-tha for indescribable views of the city (well in our case, bagging a lift to the top with the execs) and arriving at uni at 5am to purchase tickets for the Byron Bay trip. Another highlight was visiting Surfer’s Paradise which is easily accessible from Brisbane; another advantage to living here! Here, I attempted surfing for the first time in a sea where the waves towered over me. I would’ve had photos to share but one huge wave in particular robbed my GoPro from my hand and it is now lost in the sea forever. Regardless of this it was one of the best weekends I’ve had and I couldn’t help thinking how lucky I was to be living in such a beautiful place for the next 6 months. Alas, my mini holiday is over and I’m back to studying. This feels very strange as our end-of-year exams were only last month but at least I’ll have a long Christmas holiday with no exams – bliss!</p><p></p><p>So if you’re considering studying in Aus: weigh your suitcase before leaving, keep valuables on your person on flights and if you are bringing a go pro in the sea (or anywhere really, they’re expensive) buy some sort of strap so you don’t lose it. Finally, wear sun cream – UV radiation is dangerous here and be careful with your choice of clothing to avoid bad tan lines…</p>"

It was one of the best things I’ve ever done; there’s no feeling that compares! Skydiving has been number one on my bucket list since I can remember but it had to be somewhere with amazing views. Where better than Australia!?</p><p>After arriving at the site at 9am, we had five hours of waiting. This only added to the suspense but soon enough I was so eager to get in the plane that the nerves had turned to excitement. I finally met my tandem partner, Marc, who tried countless times to get a reaction from me. He told me he’d only just started the job (he’d been there 5 years) and then tried to convince me that Julian Rocks was New Zealand. Although his intention was to scare me, I was laughing so much that I felt at ease.</p><p>I thought getting into the rickety little plane and ascending 14,000 feet into the sky would be when I started to freak out but this was not the case. Even though the only thing between me and the huge drop was a sheet of plastic they call a door, I couldn’t help but feel content looking out over the views of Byron Bay: Australia’s most easterly point. I even saw whales splashing about in the sea on the way up. Soon after this, the door opened and all the cold air came rushing in. Here, I realised I had never been in a plane with the door open.</p><p>I was one of the first to go. I sat on the edge of the plane in the shape of a banana as instructed: head back, arms grasped tightly to the harness and legs tucked under. This was the most frightening part of all as I knew I was escaping safety but it only lasted a few seconds. Next thing I knew, I was whirling out of the plane and everything was happening so fast. These first few seconds were a huge blur to me due to a sensory overload but after the initial turbulence, the motion became smooth. In the midst of it all, my ears popped and I couldn’t hear a thing but this only made it more serene; I was undergoing the most blissful experience of my life.</p><p>Marc then tapped me on the shoulder as a signal to open my arms and it no longer felt like I was falling, rather floating. I could clearly see the vast openness below in all its glory. Not once did I think about anything going wrong and any sense of fear I had before had completely vanished; I felt scared in safety and fearless in danger. Then, after sixty seconds had passed, the parachute opened. Everything slowed right down and I found myself drifting peacefully back to the drop zone. My ability to hear returned and Marc reached out his hand for a high five. The sense of freedom was incredible and I did not stop smiling from start to finish.</p><p>Will smith said “God placed the best things in life on the other side of terror” which could not be more true. I already can’t wait for my next skydive. Who knows, maybe one day I’ll do it solo!</p>"

          "html": "<p>Brisbane is an ideal place to live in Australia if you want to travel. Many will agree, the East Coast has the most beautiful places to visit and Bris is conveniently right in the middle.</p><p>Although my course was pretty full on (with at least two assignments each week, midterms and online quizzes) I worked to have most weekends free. Some of the places I visited were: Byron Bay, Sydney, Melbourne, Whitsundays, Fraser Island and New Zealand. My favorite place, however, was Heron Island.</p><p>Similar to my course in Manchester, I was able to take one module outside of Maths. After being informed that there was a module that brought you to the Great barrier reef, I soon enrolled onto Australia’s marine environment. This course is designed for exchange students and almost everyone I became friends with enrolled too.</p><p>Visiting the Great Barrier Reef has always been on my bucket list and I couldn’t have experienced it in a better way. You may have seen Heron Island on Blue Planet II. It’s a small sand island surrounded by coral reef, away from tall buildings and the impact of modern civilization. The coral stretches for miles beyond the distance; there are few places in the world where you can literally walk on the reef but Heron Island is one of them. You can also walk around the whole island in less than 30 minutes. Rays swim right beside in the shallows of the pristine water and turtles come ashore to lay their eggs.</p><p></p><p>The visit was intended as a field trip but it did not feel like work and most of the time was spent snorkeling. We snorkeled at sunrise, midday and sunset. Watching the sun go down amidst tropical fish was particularly beautiful.</p><p></p><p>We swam with manta rays, turtles, jellyfish and sharks. The sharks on the reef are pretty harmless as long as they do not feel threatened and the turtles were friendly swimmers. Often, something new would swim beside me and I’d be in a state of amazement all over again.</p><p></p><p>This experience gave me the chance to witness so many beautiful things but also made me extremely aware of how the Great Barrier reef is changing. Soon it will no longer be possible to see it as it is today. The Reef is under threat from bleaching due to acidification and increasing temperatures and this causes long term damage and death of the coral in some cases.</p><p>Sir David Attenborough is passionate about this matter. He describes the reef as ‘one of the greatest, and most splendid natural treasures that the world possesses’ and has dedicated a lot of time to prevent further damage. He has also created this site to give a deeper understanding and provide knowledge into how others can help.</p><p><a rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"http://www.attenboroughsreef.com/\" href=\"http://www.attenboroughsreef.com/\"><u>http://www.attenboroughsreef.com/</u></a></p><p>Furthermore, the University of Queensland has it’s own research station on Heron Island where incredible work is being done to protect the reef – one of the many incentives to study at UQ if you’re interested in marine biology. However, there is still much to be done. It is a global matter that affects everyone, not just Australia and it would be a huge waste for it to disappear. There certainly are few places in the world like this.</p>"
